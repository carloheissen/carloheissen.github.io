### About me:

I am a theoretical physics working on (quantum) field theory, scattering amplitudes, gravitational waves. Since 2023, I am a [postdoctoral fellow at Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/heissenbergc.html), my research is supported by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) via the grant ["EikoGrav"](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FX037312%2F1).

My research focuses on the classical limit of scattering amplitudes and their application to the calculation of
gravitational-wave observables in the post-Minkowskian approximation. I am also interested in asymptotic
symmetries, soft theorems and memory effects in gauge theories and gravity.
